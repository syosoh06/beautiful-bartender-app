The practicum needs to be packaged independently so that a person can click on the Index.html and the application will open automatically in their Browser.

Your solution will be evaluated on code organization and structure, readability, maintainability, and responsive design.  Use HTML 5, CSS3, and any javascript libraries/frameworks you prefer.

Rules:
ï	Allow the user to make as many drinks as they can until the ingredients are gone.
ï	Users can increase the number of each drink
ï	Users can decrease the number each of drink
ï	When an ingredient runs out, all drinks that require the ingredient can no longer have their order count increased
ï	When ingredients are made available(by decreasing a beverage count), all drinks that require it can once again have their order increased
ï	When the user places an order, a summary should be displayed on a new screen that prins out the total of each drink and the total number of drinks

Design:
ï	The design should be responsive
ï	We have included PNG files of every screen as well as a Photoshop (.psd) file.
ï	We have included the plus/minus buttons as transparent PNG files, though it is also possible to create those using fonts.
ï	We have included the font, Source Sans Pro, which is a Google web font
ï	The headings (ìBar Stockî, ìOrdersî) are Source Sans Pro Extralight
ï	The units of measurement (I.e. ML, OZ) are Source Sans Pro Bold
ï	The number of drinks ordered in the interface are Source Sans Pro Bold
ï	Everything else is Source Sans Pro Regular
